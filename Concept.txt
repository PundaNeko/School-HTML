Website concept:

Panda page: 
Bamboo forest BG + panda picture
random introduction to the panda (AI Generated seems fine),
more uncanny the better.
rifle inside the self introduction.
on click Speech bubble on panda, on panda click panda moves while being pissed off
second click: panda goes to another place and reduces their opacity
third click panda dies and the real page shows. (don't forget to roast the viewer for killing an innocent panda)
story formatting will be all over the place.
the you can find me here part will be clickable in "you" "find" and "here".
"you" will display monster in the introduction for a moment before returning to normal if panda has been clicked at least once.
"find" will show "Please don't" in introduction box for a moment.
"here" will show "nope" in the intro box.
clicking the panda without the rifle will display a heart emoji.
hovering the panda the second go will open a modal that say's "please don't do this"
introduction background will be a glass case with the rifle behind it.
clicking the introduction will turn the cursor into a crosshair and the gun will disappear. (there is no putting the rifle back)

Intermission page: 
big words in middle: 
"I see you've embraced your inner monster..."
"Very well, as much as I hate it, I must greet my kind personally"
--> Gunshot towards viewer
"You, me, us, them, we may all be different outside"
"But in the end, we're all the same inside aren't we."
"My name is--"
--> Real Page
